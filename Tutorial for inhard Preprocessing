InHARD Dataset Preprocessing Tutorial in Colab
This tutorial guides you through preprocessing the INHARD dataset in Google Colab. The process involves downloading the dataset from a public repository, storing it on your Google Drive, extracting dataframes (if available), and saving action frames per target class as separate folders.

Prerequisites:

A Google account and access to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)
Basic understanding of Python
Steps:

1. Mount Google Drive:

Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate your Google account. This allows you to access and manage files on your Google Drive from Colab.
2. Create Dataset Directory (Optional):
3. Install Required Libraries:
Run the following code cell to install the libraries needed for data manipulation, video processing, and file system interactions:

import pandas as pd
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np


5. Download the INHARD Dataset (Choose a Method):

!wget https://zenodo.org/records/4003541/files/01-InHARD.7z.001?download=1

6. Extract the Dataset :

!7za x 01-InHARD.7z.001

6. Define Paths:

Set the following variables to specify the locations of the INHARD dataset and the output directory for storing extracted frames:

# Define paths
dataset_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/datasets/Segmented/RGBSegmented'  # Update with your actual dataset path
output_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/FramesperLabel/'                 # Update with your desired output path


Replace dataset_path with the actual path to your unzipped INHARD dataset directory (containing video folders).
Replace output_path with the desired location on your Google Drive where you want to save the extracted action frames per class.
7. Frame Extraction Function:

8. Preprocess Dataset:

The code iterates through the class folders within the dataset path (dataset_path) and calls the extract_frames function for each video file. This extracts frames and saves them in separate folders within the specified output_path, using the class label as the folder name.
10. Run the Preprocessing Script:

Once you've replaced the placeholders (<URL>, dataset_path, and output_path) with your specific details, run all the code cells in your Colab notebook.
